## Tools and Materials
1.) For this final project, our team chose the Unity Game Engine because of its user-friendly design and the convenience of using the C# programming language. Unity's accessibility for developers of all levels is complemented by the powerful scripting language C#, which enhances the overall ease and efficiency of the development process. This combination allows us to efficiently bring our creative ideas to life and ensures a smooth development process.

2.) Our team chose C# for this project because the Unity Game Engine is built to work with the C# language. Using C# for our project with Unity makes things easier and ensures that the programming language and game engine work well together.

3.) We will use Visual Studio Code as our IDE for this project.

## Outlook
This will be the first time using Unity and C# for some group members. Although we'll still use the engine for its above benefits, we'll still need to dedicate some extra time to teach them and get them acclimated to the environment. By the end of this project, we are hoping to earn further practice and familiarize ourselves with
the toolset provided within Unity. This will allow us to develop a set of skills in which can be applied to
future Unity based projects in the future.
