# Devlog Entry - 20 November 2023
## Introducing the Team
Tools Lead: Joshua Widjaja
Engine Lead: Chase Houske
Design Lead: Nicholas Puckdee

## Tools and Materials
1.) For this final project, our team chose the Unity Game Engine because of its user-friendly design and the convenience of using the C# programming language. Unity's accessibility for developers of all levels is complemented by the powerful scripting language C#, which enhances the overall ease and efficiency of the development process. This combination allows us to efficiently bring our creative ideas to life and ensures a smooth development process.

2.) Our team chose C# for this project because the Unity Game Engine is built to work with the C# language. Using C# for our project with Unity makes things easier and ensures that the programming language and game engine work well together.

Tell us about which tools you expect to use in the process of authoring your project. You might name the IDE for writing code, the image editor for creating visual assets, or the 3D editor you will use for building your scene. Again, briefly tell us why you made these choices. Maybe one of your teammates feels especially skilled in that tool or it represents something you all want to learn about.
3.) To be continued...
