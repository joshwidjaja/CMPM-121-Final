# Devlog Entry - 20 November 2023
## Introducing the Team
Tools Lead: Joshua Widjaja

Engine Lead: Chase Houske

Design Lead: Nicholas Puckdee

Pallavi Rajeev

Reese Garcia

## Tools and Materials
1.) For this final project, our team chose the Unity Game Engine because of its user-friendly design and the convenience of using the C# programming language. Unity's accessibility for developers of all levels is complemented by the powerful scripting language C#, which enhances the overall ease and efficiency of the development process. This combination allows us to efficiently bring our creative ideas to life and ensures a smooth development process.

2.) Our team chose C# for this project because the Unity Game Engine is built to work with the C# language. Using C# for our project with Unity makes things easier and ensures that the programming language and game engine work well together.

3.) We will use Visual Studio Code as our IDE for this project. We're using it because we've pretty much used it in all our other classes and it has useful features like intellisense.

(Resubmit)

Tell us about which tools you expect to use in the process of authoring your project. You might name the IDE for writing code, the image editor for creating visual assets, or the 3D editor you will use for building your scene. Again, briefly tell us why you made these choices. Maybe one of your teammates feels especially skilled in that tool or it represents something you all want to learn about.

## Outlook
This will be the first time using Unity and C# for some group members. Although we'll still use the engine for its above benefits, we'll still need to dedicate some extra time to teach them and get them acclimated to the environment. By the end of this project, we are hoping to earn further practice and familiarize ourselves with
the toolset provided within Unity. This will allow us to develop a set of skills in which can be applied to
future Unity based projects in the future.

## How we satisfied the software requirements
For each of the F0 requirements, give a paragraph of explanation for how your game’s implementation satisfies the requirements.
Your team can earn partial credit for covering only a subset of the F0 requirements at this stage. (It is much better to satisfy the requirements in a sloppy way right now than lock in your partial credit.)

[F0.g] 

## Reflection
Looking back on how you achieved the F0 requirements, how has your team’s plan changed? Did you reconsider any of the choices you previously described for Tools and Materials or your Roles? It would be very suspicious if you didn’t need to change anything. There’s learning value in you documenting how your team’s thinking has changed over time.
